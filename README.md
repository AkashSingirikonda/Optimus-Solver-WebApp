# OptiMUS Solver

This repo contains the code for backend and frontend of [OptiMUS Solver Web App](https://optimus-solver.com/). For OptiMUS paper repositories, see [OptiMUS GitHub Repository](https://github.com/teshnizi/OptiMUS).

## Structure

The backend, built with Flask, is located in the [`api/`](api/) directory. The frontend, a React application, can be found in the [`app/`](app/) directory.

## Dataset

You can download the dataset from [https://huggingface.co/datasets/udell-lab/NLP4LP](https://huggingface.co/datasets/udell-lab/NLP4LP). Please note that NLP4LP is intended and licensed for research use only. The dataset is CC BY NC 4.0 (allowing only non-commercial use) and models trained using the dataset should not be used outside of research purposes (The updated version will be added soon).

## Running the project locally 

What you need:
- A system with python and node/npm installed
- A [firestore project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) with a [service account](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/service-accounts).

Steps:
0. Create a Firestore project on Firebase, and download a json credential key for it. Here are the steps:
- Go to the Firebase Console and select your Firebase project (Create one if you don't have one)
- Open Project Settings: In the Firebase console, click on the gear icon next to Project Overview in the sidebar. Select Project settings from the dropdown.
- Navigate to Service Accounts: In the Project settings page, click on the Service accounts tab at the top
- Generate a New Private Key: Under the Firebase Admin SDK section, click on Generate new private key. Firebase will create a new private key in JSON format and download it to your computer automatically.
- Embed the json into base64 using `base64 -i admin_creds.json -o admin_creds_base64.txt` (change admin_creds.json to your credentials file name)

Youâ€™ll need this JSON file to authenticate your Firebase Admin SDK requests.
1. Edit [the main .env](https://github.com/OptiMUS-optimization-modeling/Optimus-Solver-WebApp/blob/main/.env) file and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` from your service account. `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` should be the base64 encoding of your firebase json credentials (explained in step 0). 
2. Edit [the frontend .env](https://github.com/OptiMUS-optimization-modeling/Optimus-Solver-WebApp/blob/main/interface/.env) file and add your frontend firebase credentials (You can get one via firebase dashboard > settings > general > add app > web app).
3. Open new terminals (so .env files take effect), create a new virtual environment, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements.
4. Start the flask backend using `flask run`.
5. Install and start the react frontend:

   ```
   cd interface/
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

6. Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

## Contribution

To contribute to the web app, please open an issue or a pull request. All code functionalities are in the [`/api/app/functionalities`](api/app/functionalities) directory.

## Adding New Solvers

To add new a new solver, please follow these steps:

1. Create a coding prompt file SOLVER_NAME.py in [Coding Prompts](https://github.com/OptiMUS-optimization-modeling/Optimus-Solver-WebApp/tree/main/api/app/functionalities/coding/prompts)
2. Create a formulation prompt file SOLVER_NAME.py in [Formulation Prompts](https://github.com/OptiMUS-optimization-modeling/Optimus-Solver-WebApp/tree/main/api/app/functionalities/formulation/prompts)
3. Create a debugging prompt file SOLVER_NAME.py in [Debugging Prompts](https://github.com/OptiMUS-optimization-modeling/Optimus-Solver-WebApp/tree/main/api/app/functionalities/debugging/prompts)
 
4. Add the solver to the dropdown list in the front end [Analysis Page](https://github.com/OptiMUS-optimization-modeling/Optimus-Solver-WebApp/blob/main/interface/src/Pages/MainApp/Analysis/AnalysisPage.js). For example for cvxpy, you should add this line  `<option value="cvxpy">cvxpy</option>`

Create a PR request to merge the code. You can look at the existing prompt files for gurobipy for reference.
